# Code Institute Milestone Project 2

## User Experience (UX)
The primary goal is to provide an appealing and fun memory game for children 3 - 7 years old.

##Â User Story
The game should be intuitive and easy to navigate for young players. Parents should be able to easily demonstrate the game to their children if necessary.

## Goals
- The game will have a simple layout with child-friendly images, font and attractive colours.
- There will be a score counter so the player can see the results.
- There will be 3 levels where the player can choose a level corresponds to their ability.
- There will not be a timer to avoid putting the player under pressure.
- It is important for the player to have fun and be able to complete the game for a sense of achievement.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
Bright and coordinating colours are used to appeal to young children.
### Font Type
The Montserrat Alternates font is the main font with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This font looks fun and informal.
### Images 
Images are crucial for a memory game. They must be clear and eye-catching to capture children's attention. They need to be distinct and easily identifiable so the player can remember them.
