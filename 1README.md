# Code Institute Milestone Project 2

## User Experience (UX)
The primary goal is to provide an appealing and fun memory game for children 3 - 6 years old.
### User Story
The game should be intuitive and easy to navigate for young players. Parents should be able to easily demonstrate the game to their children if necessary.

## Goals
- The game will have a simple layout with child-friendly images, font and attractive colours.
- There will be a score counter so the player can see the results.
- There will be 3 levels where the player can choose a level corresponds to their ability.
- There will not be a timer to avoid putting the player under pressure.
- It is important for the player to have fun and be able to complete the game for a sense of achievement.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
Bright and coordinating colours are used to appeal to young children.
### Font Type
The Montserrat Alternates font is the main font with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This font looks fun and informal.
### Images 
Images are crucial for a memory game. They must be clear and eye-catching to capture children's attention. They need to be distinct and easily identifiable so the player can remember them. Image size is optimised for viewing across platforms with particular consideration to fit on handheld devices. Animal images are chosen for young children which they might already be familiar with.
