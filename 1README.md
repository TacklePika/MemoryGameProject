# Code Institute Milestone Project 2

## User Experience (UX)
The primary goal is to provide an appealing and fun memory game for children aged 3 - 6 years old.
### User Story
The game should be intuitive and easy to navigate for young players. Parents should be able to easily demonstrate the game to their children if necessary.

## Goals
- The game will have a simple layout with child-friendly images, font and attractive colours.
- There will be a score counter so the player can see the results.
- There will be 3 levels where the player can choose a level corresponds to their ability.
- There will not be a timer to avoid putting the player under pressure.
- It is the most important for the player to have fun and be able to complete the game for a sense of achievement.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
Bright and coordinating colours are used to appeal to young children.
### Font Type
The Montserrat Alternates font is the main font with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This font looks fun and informal.
### Images 
- Images are crucial for a memory game. 
- They must be clear and eye-catching to capture children's attention. 
- They need to be distinct and easily identifiable so the player can remember them. 
- Image size is optimised with particular consideration to fit on mobile devices as this is likely to be the main platform where children will play the game with. 
- Animal images are chosen for young children which they might already be familiar with.

## Testing User Story / UX
- Upon entering the site, parents and children are welcomed by a colouful homepage with an hero image of young children and educational images. 
- The homepage states the potential benefits of memory game and provides game instructions.
- The navigation menu shows 3 levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard.
- The difficulty options are easy to select by click of a button and will bring the player to the relevant page. 
- For each gaming page, there is a counter to record the score, a grid to show the cards for each corresponding level (3x4, 3x6 and 3x8). 
- There is a restart button should the player wish to play another game.
- All pages are clean with emphasis on the game board which shows a range of animal photograph cards.
- The games are designed not to entrap the players with a timer, but to let them complete the game in their own timeframe.  
- There are no social media links which are not appropriate for young children.
- The player can learn through playing the game and improve their cognitive skills and to have fun.    

## Further Testing
- The website is tested on various browers including Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
- The website is also viewed on a variety of devices using the Google Chrome Inspect tool function across platforms such as desktop, iPad and iPhone to ensure that it is responsive.
- Testing is done repeatedly to ensure there are no broken links between the homepage and all three gaming levels.
- Family member is asked to view and play the games to identify issues if any.

## Bugs
- When using the Google Chrome Inspect tool, the game board is pushed towards the right when displayed on some mobile devices.
- The restart button is not levelled with the score counter when being moved across responsive screen.

## Deployment
The project is deployed to GitHub as follows:
- Log onto GitHub.
- Create Repository in GitHub called Memory Game Project with description.
- Open workspace in Gitpod.
- Identify and correct any issues highlighted.
- Commit changes and push across from Gitpod to Github as initial commit.
- Regularly commit all files and images on Github for progress tracking.
- Push and commit all files from Github ready for submission.
- Recheck Readme file and all files prior to final commit.
- Locate Master branch in Repository and select drop down menu from Code for the published HTTPS link.
